[Intro, Spoken]
"Have I ever told you the story of the two racist gay dudes?
Aye, grab a bottle of rhum, will ya?

[Verse]
Once upon a time in Port Royal
In a bar called the Whitest of Swans
Entered two strange fellows
With a love for each other that was strong
both white as snow
And with a love for white dong!

[Bridge]
"But they were racist as hell
And followed a scene rather extraordinaire"

[Crowd Applause]

[Chorus, Climax]
The two racist gay dudes
(Hey, Hey!)
They started socking each other off
(Because they're gay!)
And they started saying the N-word
(Because they're racist!)
That's the tale of these gentlemen
Who had a love for each other
But a deep hatred for the darker
(Why would they do that?)

[Verse]
Really, they were a sight to see
There's not much more to that story

[Spoken]
"Well, there's also the part where some dog entered the bar
But the barman kicked it out
So it's not really relevant to the story
But it's a fun fact, I guess"

[Chorus]
The two racist gay dudes
(Hey, Hey!)
They started socking each other off
(Because they're gay!)
And they started saying the N-word
(Because they're racist!)
That's the tale of these gentlemen
Who had a love for each other
But a deep hatred for the darker
(Why would they do that?)
