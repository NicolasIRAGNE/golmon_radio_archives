[Intro] [Spoken] [Radio] [Old-Timey]
"Yo, you remember that movie? With the uhhh... the dude... with the uhh... the gun?... you know what I'm sayin'?
Ah man, that was something...
I tell you what... movies these days, they ain't got nothin' on that.
You know what I'm sayin'?
The, uhh, the special effects, and the  the explosions, the gun fights, and yeah...
Oh no, I gotta go!" *click*

*record scratch*

(eh, eh)

[Verse] [Rap]
I'm a movie buff, I love the cinema
They got Robert De Niro, and that girl from Nikita
Shoutout to Jean-Luc Godard, man, that guy's a genius
Real street-cred, guy even made multiple movies
Yeah my fav one is Shining from Tarantino
That child just won't stop riding that bike, you know?

*saxophone solo*

[Pre-Chorus]
Man I just love films with actors in them
They got the drama, the action, the comedy, the mayhem

[Intermission] [Spoken] [Radio]
"Man, did you see that one with Neo? I think he was a robot.
Or maybe Morpheus was the robot.
I don't know, my grandma was talking over the whole thing. I couldn't hear a word.
I tell you what brother, this says a lot about society...
Bye!" *click*

[Verse] [Rap]
I'm a movie buff, I love the cinema
I remember that thriller, man it was a killer
the one made by a director, shot with the cameras
Yeah, lemme tell you about planet of the gorillas
Al Pacino, yeah, he's an actor
He's got the power, he's the master
"You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me?"
Yeah, i'm talkin' to you, you're the best, you see?
My favorite part of Star Wars is when they fight Voldemort
And then they go to the mordor, and they fight the dinosaurs
Oh, that's Jurassic Park? Oh, I'm sorry, Mister Know-it-all
I guess you're the expert, I guess you've seen them all

[Intermission] [Spoken] [Radio]
"Honestly, bro
The terminator is nude in that movie... Like why did they do that?
Robots aren't supposed to be naked man! Like, come on! You know what I'm sayin'?
Just put some clothes on that guy, you know?" *click*

[Verse] [Rap]
"Yeah, I'm the Taxi Driver, I'm the Raging Bull!"
Man I love Jean-Claude Van Damme, he's so cool
He's got the muscles, he's got the moves
Gotta watch all his movies, gotta get in the groove
Man, I love the movies, flicks and films alike
Films, actors, directors, even the commercials
Obi-Wan Kenobi, he's the best cowboy in the west
Gotta watch that movie, they shoot him in the chest
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, they shoulda used a uzi
Woulda been a better movie, I'm just sayin', you see?

[Outro]
I'm a movie buff, I love the cinema
Alfred Hitchcock, he's like film David Guetta
(He's like film David Guetta (He's like film David Guetta))

[Fade Out]
J'adore les endives et les chicons
